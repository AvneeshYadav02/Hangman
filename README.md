Hangman Game
A simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game, written in Python. This is a beginner-level project created to practice Python basics.

Features
Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
Displays a visual representation of the hangman using ASCII art.
Tracks correct and incorrect guesses.
Limits the player to 6 incorrect guesses (lives).
Displays a victory or defeat message at the end.
How to Play
The program will randomly select a word from a predefined word list.
You have 6 lives to guess the word correctly, one letter at a time.
Each incorrect guess reduces your lives by 1, and the hangman figure progresses.
If you guess all the letters correctly before running out of lives, you win!
If you lose all your lives, the game ends, and the correct word is revealed.
